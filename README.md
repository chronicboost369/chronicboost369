* Personal Projects
  1. FOMC Statement and Stock Market (QQQ) Prediction - https://github.com/chronicboost369/FOMC_statement-Market-Prediction
     Scraped statements from the Fed's website, preprocessed using nltk, tested several models, and evaluated the result. Currently, stalled due to issues with gathering other financial data.
  2. Loan Default Prediction - https://github.com/chronicboost369/Master-s-Final
     Cleaned data (from Kaggle), conducted EDA & compared several models. Evaluated the top 2 best performing models(Logistic & XGBoost) using a custom performance matrix (loss given default) and discussed the reasons of similar performance despite differences in complexity.
